Great idea! You're essentially describing an **automated invoice management system with integrated tax intelligence** – which could be incredibly valuable for freelancers, small businesses, and even tax advisors.

Let's break this into parts to define the **core concept**, suggest **MVP features**, and outline an **initial tech stack** and roadmap.

---

### ✅ App Concept: **“Računko” – Smart Invoice + Tax Management App**

A modern, localized invoicing platform that:

* **Creates & manages invoices**
* Tracks **clients, payments, and due dates**
* Automatically **syncs latest tax regulations** via scraping government/regulatory websites
* Alerts you about **tax changes, VAT rules, reverse charge obligations, deadlines**
* Works **offline/online**, **multi-device**, with **PDF export, email send**, etc.

### 🧭 Roadmap

#### Phase 1 – MVP (4–6 weeks)

* [ ] Invoice CRUD
* [ ] Client storage
* [ ] Basic PDF invoice export
* [ ] VAT toggle + total calculator
* [ ] Tax scraper (basic version)

#### Phase 2 – Cloud & Intelligence (6–8 weeks)

* [ ] Add scraping scheduler (e.g., cron)
* [ ] Notification UI + alert system
* [ ] Invoice sync + backup (cloud/local)
* [ ] Localization (HR, EN, EU formats)
* [ ] User auth & multi-user support

#### Phase 3 – Advanced Features

* [ ] Recurring invoices
* [ ] Accounting integration (e.g., FINA, ePorezna)
* [ ] OCR for receipts
* [ ] Porezna/Fina API integrations (if available)
* [ ] Invoice number rules based on years/clients

---

### 💡 Optional Smart Features

* **OIB validation & company autofill** (scrape/open registry)
* **Tax calendar with deadlines** (e.g. PDV submission dates)
* **“Is this deductible?” AI assistant** for expenses
* **Custom invoice themes** (Freelancer / Consultant / Business)
* **Offline mode with sync** (PWA)

---

### 🔍 Questions to refine direction

* Do you want this as a **web-only**, **desktop**, or **mobile-friendly PWA**?
* Will it support **multiple businesses/companies per user**?
* Will you include **receipt scanning / expense tracking** in future?
* Do you want to support **e-invoicing formats** (e.g. eRačun for Croatia)?

---

### ➕ Example Scraping Targets for Tax Info (Croatia)

* [Porezna uprava](https://www.porezna-uprava.hr/)
* [Narodne novine](https://narodne-novine.nn.hr/) for new laws
* EU VAT database (if international invoicing)

Would you like me to:

* Scaffold the project structure (e.g. Next.js + Express + Prisma)?
* Generate a logo/brand concept for “Računko”?
* Help write the scraper for tax data?

Let me know where you want to start, and we’ll go step by step.
